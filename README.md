# Sawada-Necklace-Algorithm-for-Python

The most efficient algorithm for generating necklaces from a list of elements. Adapted from Joe Sawada's algorithm - paper here http://www.cis.uoguelph.ca/~sawada/papers/alph.pdf - I adapted the c code from his website into a python class, it could probably be made to be more pythonic or whatever but I'm happy with this. Just initialize the object with a list as the argument and it'll spit out the necklaces into the necklaces member.
